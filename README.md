# Project_SO_2
The main goal of this work is to test and stress some sort of server from client requests. There are three servers: FIFO(sequential request managment), 
Heavy process(concurrent managment) and Pre Heavy Process(schedule managment). For these three servers there is the same client, wich is executed specifying 
number of threads and cicles that are sending requests to stress those servers mentioned above.
There is python section, wich graphs the statistics of each server, in order to evaluate performance in each case.
